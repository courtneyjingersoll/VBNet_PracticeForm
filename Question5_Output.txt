Clinician Visit:
When I arrived at the clinic, the nurse escorted me to an exam room and took my basic vitals.
The clinician then came into the room and asked me about my reason for visiting.
I told her how I have been having a persistant pain in my nose and how it was tender to the touch.
She examined my nose and confirmed that it was inflamed.
The clinician told me how this was a sign of an infection in the nose and perscribed two different broad-spectrum antibiotics. 
She told me to contact her again if the infection seemed to be getting worse after a couple days, as a different antibiotic might be needed.
The clinician otherwise stressed the importance of finishing the fulllength of the dosage to ensure the bacteria was fully wiped out.
I thanked the clinician for her time, and left the clinic.
