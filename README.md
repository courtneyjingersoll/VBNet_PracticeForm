# VBNet_Practice Form

Contains 9 practice problems involving file input/output, data formatting, form element resizing, timers, string manipulation, dynamically-sized arrays, collections, virtual classes and class inheritance, object creation, exceptions handling (including custom exceptions), and multi-threading.

By default, the form will look for input files in E:\Boot Camp\VisualBasic Programming\FormTest but this can be changed during runtime wihtin the form itself or by updating the class constant DEFAULT_FILEPATH at the top of FormTest.vb

The form will use 4 input files and generate 5 output files.

The 9 practice problems covered by the form are:
 - Question 1: Reading in lines from a file, display any numbers along with their hexadecimal value. Then display the total sum of the numbers to a precision of 2 decimal places.
 - Question 2: Reading in a list of potential dates, convert only the valid ones to yyyy-mm-dd formatting.
 - Question 3: When a form is resized, update the form elements to resize with it.
 - Question 4: Display two timers, one twice as fast as the other, that count up to 10 then reset back to 0.   
 - Question 5: Reading text from a file, count the number of words and lines, replace "doctor" with "clinician", count the number of replacements, and display the updated text along with each tally.
 - Question 6: Reading in text from question 5, sort each unique word into a dynamically-sized array.  Sort the list of words and display in a listbox.
 - Question 7: Inherit a virtual class, Shape, to create classes Rectangle and Square. Create and display Square And Rectangle objects from file input.
 - Question 8: Every time the button is pressed, begin a new thread. Allow the form to be resized while the threads run.
 - Question 9: Given a randomly generated exception, display an appropriate error message in a message box.
